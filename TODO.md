## Web
- Basic site for now
- Don't need formatting, just some basic elements to output to
- Make it fancy later

## JS
- Percentage -> time period
- Time period -> display (year+decimal->year/month/day, fact, etc)
  - Call other functions to get this done, not just one big function
  - should be a library or something for data format to use local format
  - Only full date for recent years, then just year, then thousand/mil/bil years ago

## Other
- Get data
- Decide on data format (csv/etc)
- Set up Github to host the page
  - Alex on this now
